# RosLab
For grabbing fluorescent microscopy data and analyzing it for the real CM factors
# Code descriptions
  - The Notebook no longer works as it ran off an old code but it should show you a little about how the script normally runs
  - The Main function of the Ros_CM Plotter is the function that does everything think the brain of the script. It isn't the best code and can be improved severely but it works well in its current state
  - The last python file plots the theory plots and you can easily change the initial values for the plots.
